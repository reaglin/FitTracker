# FitTracker Android Application

The FitTracker application is based on a simple fitness theory. Performing any exercise until it becomes challenging has definite fitness advantages. An example is pushups. Pushups done daily, but not to the point of challenge, have limited advantage for building strength and muscle. However, if you push just a single set to the point of difficulty, there are tremendous benefits. 

FitTracker allows you to create exercises and specify the limit to where they are challenging. 50 pushups, 4 miles running, 20 squats, etc. These are entered as exercises and are kept in a list. You can enter as many of these as you want, and you can change the amount of reps, miles, time, or any other measure as you improve. 

Every day, as you complete any exercise, you can mark the completion by clicking a single button for that day. The application tracks what you have completed. You can set goals, such as completing any 5 or 6 exercises every day. The application tracks your progress with all the exercises and the overall progress and completion of each exercise.
